## About

Five months ago (December, 2016) I did my first commit in my first open source project 🚀.

The idea is simple, with `TextFieldCounter` you can set the max length of a `UITextField` quickly, also, it includes a label to show the size of text (it's possible show it by ascending or descending way - Thanks [@jerherrero](https://github.com/jerherrero)). 

`TextFieldCounter` is writed in Swift 3.0, but, some days ago (October, 2017) I merged a pull request that makes the component support Swift 4, thanks [@darthpelo](https://github.com/darthpelo).
