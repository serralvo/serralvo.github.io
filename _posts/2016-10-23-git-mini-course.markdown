PUC-Campinas' XVIII Integration Week took place a month ago, and there I had the opportunity to talk about Git. It was an awesome experience, and here I'll explain why!

### The Event

The Integration Week is an event hosted by PUC-Campinas and organized by volunteer students from CEATEC (Center of Exact, Environmental and Technological Sciences), where great activities are offered, like mini courses, lectures and workshops.

### Mini-course's Objective

Version control, in general, is an essencial tool in software development process. Nowadays every company in the world use some kind of version control software. The mini course objective was to introduce basic version control concepts and practice it in an activity using Github's platform.

### Material

You can get the Keynote here.

### Conclusion

In two hours I had the opportunity to share my knowledge with twenty students, but, isn't just that, this number will change, why am I thinking it? The answer: in 2013 I signed up in an activity like this and three years late I went to the same build to talk about the same subject, Git. 

// TO-DO: Finish the conclusion.
