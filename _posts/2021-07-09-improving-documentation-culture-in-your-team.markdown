Documentation is a relevant topic in the software industry, especially when projects or products start growth and teams' structure became more distant or distributed. My goal in this article is to give few tips about documentation and how to make this process natural. Before start, I'll assume that your team already see value in the documentation.

## Understand what to document 
Before starting to document is important to understand what your team needs to document, which information is relevant for every context, to do it you need to catch the big picture and explore that. What truly matters for the team's engineers? And for Product Managers? Product Designers? Each people see different levels of relevance in each piece of information, for me, the best way to understand this level of relevance is to talk with everybody in the same room and point the highest topics, for example:

Are your team working on features for mobile apps? Consider documenting in what app version the features were launched, this could be relevant for Product Managers (these will use it on their analysis) and for Software Engineers (may use it on monitoring). Another one, there some remote configuration or feature toggle? Consider adding it in the documentation to have an easy and centralized access.

After figure out those topics I'd recommend to create a kind of template, this task ir part of the next topic, to have success into documentation the process should be easy.

## Make it easy
Every person in your team should be able to create or edit documentation in just a few clicks, no matter how technical this person is, consider using tools that are visual and easy to use, markdown is cool, and I as Software Engineer agree with that, but I'm not sure if a Product Manager would like to do a commit to update something.


## Make it visible
Centralized, easy to find and related content, 

## Iterate over the process
