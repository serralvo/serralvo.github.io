Automated tests are an important topic when we are talking about software quality, and when your team or project starts to grow new challenges appear, in this article, I'll cover some aspects / issues of unit tests in big teams. 

First of all, when a project starts to grow fast (in this case fast means double the size in less than a year) and in a non-structured way (without documentation, guidelines, onboarding) some situations can happen, for example: 

New developers tend to write code following non-documented guidelines, which means "I looked in our features the _patterns_ and I followed that" or "I asked for help and someone said me to follow _this way_". As expected, this situation will happen with unit tests too.
