### ðŸ˜•

In 2016 I've wrote here about Futs, I was pride about the app and happy with the way used to solve the problem. 

Two years after the first release, I've removed the app from App Store, there are a list of reasons: 

- The backend wasn't good enough, for example, we had a lot of problems with Push Notifications.
- It's **really** hard to get into the market without an app for Android.
- The app hadn't  a business plan. I've thought about that once or twice, but, nothing was done.

So, I love sports in general (specialy Football), so, probably I'll work in another project in this area, but, for now, it's the end of Futs.
