# Singletons and Testing in Swift

Singleton is a very popular design pattern on Apple's ecosystem. You probably have faced `Network.shared`, `UserDefaults.standards`, or other similar implementations around your project. To be honest, I think you probably have a Singleton made by your team in your project and you are here looking for some solution that helps you add testability to it. The good news is: you found it.

Before we start talking about the solution, let's go back to the unit testing theory: to write acceptable unit tests you should have control and visibility of **inputs**, **outputs**, and **states** of what you are testing. Let me give a basic example:

Imagine that we have a class that calculates how much discount customer will get, based on the price of the product:

```swift
struct Product {
    let price: Double
}

class DiscountCalculator {
    func calculate(with product: Product) -> Double {
        let price = product.price
        if price <= 100 {
            return price * 0.05
        } else {
            return price * 0.10
        }
    }
}

```

So, easy to test `DiscountCalculator`, right? We can inject the product, call `calculate(with product: Product)` function and check if result is expected:

```swift

private let sut = DiscountCalculator()

func test_calculate_withProductThatPriceIsHigherThan100_shouldReturn10PercentageDiscount() {
    let product = Product(price: 150)
    
    let discount = sut.calculate(with: product)
    
    XCTAssertEqual(discount, 15)
}

```

Perfect, for this example we have control of all **inputs** (`Product`) and visibility of **outputs** (the `Double` that is returned by `calculate` function). There's no **state** here for while. 

But now, imagine that we should give an extra discount if our customer is subscribed to a kind of rewards program and this information can change any time while the customer uses the app, so, and, for our luck, this information is stored into a Singleton.

```swift

enum Reward {
    case subscribed
    case unsubscribed
}

class CustomerManager {

    static var shared: CustomerManager = {
        let manager = CustomerManager()
        return manager
    }()

    private init() {}
    
    private var customerReward: Reward?
    
    func setCustomerReward(_ reward :Reward) {
        customerReward = reward
    }

    func getReward() -> Reward {
        return customerReward ?? Reward.unsubscribed
    }
}

``` 

So, what we can do? We can use the `CustomerManager` on `DiscountCalculator` to give the extra discount and everything is gonna be ok:

```swift

class DiscountCalculator {
    func calculate(with product: Product) -> Double {
        let price = product.price
        let discountByPrice: Double
        
        if price <= 100 {
            discountByPrice = price * 0.05
        } else {
            discountByPrice = price * 0.10
        }
        
        let customerReward = CustomerManager.shared.getReward()        
        switch customerReward {
        case .subscribed:
            return discountByPrice + (price * 0.10)
        case .unsubscribed:
            return discountByPrice
        }
    }
}

```
Perfect ðŸŽ‰, this works fine and our customers will be happy with these discounts! ðŸ¤‘

Now, time to talk about Singletons! What's the main goal of a singleton? To keep a unique and shared instance of something throughout the app's lifecycle. Here we have a big issue about testability, do you remember the point about have control of **state** 

So, what's the problem with Singletons and Tests? The answer is related to a requirement of unit testing and a characteristic of singletons in general:
